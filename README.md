# System Info Page in an HTML file

In the event that you needed a script to do this:

1) Download script  
2) chmod 755 sysinfo_page
3) ./sysinfo_page
    -h 
    -i interactive mode
    -f [FILENAME]
    
    If you don't provide name, it is sysinfo_page.html in home directory
    If you do provide a name, it is in the same directory where the script lives
    
And now you can put your system information on the internet for the world to see
