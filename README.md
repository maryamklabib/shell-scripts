# System Info Page in an HTML file

In the event that you needed a script to do this:

 1. Download script  
 1. `chmod 755 sysinfo_page`
 1. `./sysinfo_page`

   1. -h 
   1. -i interactive mode
   1. -f [FILENAME]
    
    _If you don't provide name, it is sysinfo_page.html in home directory_
    _If you do provide a name, it is in the same directory where the script lives_
    
And now you can put your system information on the internet for the world to see
